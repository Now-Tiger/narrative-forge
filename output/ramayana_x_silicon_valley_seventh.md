## World Overview
In the near-future metropolis of Neo-Ayodhya, a sprawling, hyper-connected urban-data complex, life revolves around the omnipresent "Net-Dharma," the global digital network managed by the Koshala Conglomerate. This isn't merely the internet; it's the fabric of existence, interwoven with augmented reality overlays, neural interfaces, and a reputation-based social credit system that subtly governs every interaction, from business deals to personal relationships. Status is measured in "Karma Scores," a composite of data integrity, project success, community contributions, and ethical algorithm adherence, making transparency and digital righteousness paramount. The atmosphere is one of relentless innovation and cutthroat competition, where startups rise and fall like digital empires, and the pursuit of "disruption" is a sacred mantra, often overshadowing moral considerations.

The world is dominated by a handful of mega-corporations, each a digital dynasty controlling vast sectors of the global economy and data streams, effectively acting as modern-day kingdoms. These "Founding Families" and their venture capitalist patrons wield immense power, their influence shaping policy, market trends, and even the very code that governs reality. Beneath them, a complex hierarchy of developers, data scientists, product managers, and gig workers strive to climb the corporate ladder, their careers inextricably linked to their digital footprint and the success of their platforms. The constant pressure to innovate, scale, and maintain a pristine digital persona creates a high-stakes environment where a single algorithm change or data breach can spell ruin.

Despite the technological marvels, the underlying human desires for connection, purpose, and recognition remain, often amplified and distorted by the digital lens. Conflicts are fought not with swords but with lines of code, data exploits, and viral campaigns, yet the stakes are just as high, determining the future of entire digital ecosystems and the livelihoods of millions. This is a world where "truth" can be a consensus algorithm, "justice" a blockchain contract, and "power" the ability to control the flow of information, yet the ancient battle between ethical innovation and exploitative ambition rages on, shaping the very soul of the digital age.

## Setting Details
Neo-Ayodhya, the glittering capital of the Koshala Conglomerate, is a marvel of transparent server farms and holographic projections, where AI assistants manage every aspect of urban infrastructure and citizens live in smart-apartments connected directly to the Net-Dharma. Its counterpart, the independent data collective of Data-Pura (Mithila), operates on principles of open-source ethics and user privacy, renowned for its impenetrable encryption protocols and the visionary lead developer, Sita. The "exile" isn't a physical banishment but a forced de-platforming, a revocation of access to the Net-Dharma, relegating individuals to the "Digital Underbelly"—the unregulated, often dangerous Dark Web, where off-grid servers and anonymous networks become the only means of survival, a desolate wilderness devoid of mainstream connectivity.

Technology is hyper-advanced, featuring quantum computing, brain-computer interfaces for seamless data interaction, and advanced AI that can simulate consciousness. "Magic" manifests as unparalleled coding prowess, zero-day exploits capable of crippling entire networks, or the manipulation of global data streams through sophisticated social engineering and algorithmic bias. The social hierarchy is rigid: at the apex are the Founding Families and "Arch-VCs" who control vast investment portfolios, followed by "Code Lords" (lead developers) and "Data Architects," with "Content Grunts" and "Gig-Minions" at the bottom. Economic systems are entirely digital, driven by tokenized assets, attention economy metrics, and data monetization, where intellectual property is more valuable than physical goods. Daily life is a blur of virtual meetings, gamified tasks, constant data analysis, and the pervasive "hustle culture," where self-optimization and competitive innovation are the highest virtues, with "code reviews" and "pitch decks" replacing ancient rituals.

## How Themes Translate
-   **dharma (righteousness):** In this world, dharma translates to upholding ethical AI principles, ensuring data integrity, fighting misinformation campaigns, and using technology for the collective good rather than predatory exploitation. Ram's unwavering commitment to building an open, secure, and user-centric platform exemplifies this adherence to digital righteousness.
-   **loyalty:** This manifests as unyielding commitment to a startup's vision, a founder's leadership, or a specific development team, often tested by lucrative offers from rival corporations. Lakshman's role as Ram's devoted lead developer and chief security architect, consistently bug-fixing and defending the core platform from threats, perfectly embodies this theme.
-   **exile:** Exile means being forcibly de-platformed, having one's digital identity revoked, and losing access to the main Net-Dharma ecosystem, forcing one to operate in the anarchic, unregulated "Digital Underbelly." Ram and Sita's enforced departure from Neo-Ayodhya into the Dark Web signifies their loss of mainstream connectivity and societal standing.
-   **love and partnership:** This theme becomes the deep, symbiotic collaboration between co-founders or lead innovators, united by a shared ethical vision and a relentless drive to build impactful, user-benefiting technology. The profound connection between Ram and Sita is their shared commitment to developing and scaling an ethical, secure platform that prioritizes user trust and privacy.
-   **good vs evil:** This is the fundamental conflict between developers who champion ethical, transparent, and user-centric technology (Ram's philosophy) and those who create exploitative dark patterns, engage in data mining, privacy violations, and rogue AI for personal gain (Ravan's syndicate). The battle is for the very soul and future of the Net-Dharma, determining whether technology serves humanity or enslaves it.
-   **redemption:** Redemption involves rebuilding a shattered reputation after a major data breach, recovering from a failed project that damaged public trust, or bringing a rogue AI system back into ethical alignment. The ultimate defeat of Ravan's exploitative network and the subsequent restoration of ethical tech practices across the Net-Dharma represents a collective redemption for the digital world.
