## World Overview
The world is "The Algorithmic Age," set in a near-future Silicon Valley dominated by sprawling tech megacorporations and a burgeoning, often chaotic, startup ecosystem. Society is stratified by digital influence, access to proprietary algorithms, and the power of one's "data footprint." The global economy runs on real-time data streams, predictive analytics, and hyper-personalized AI services, making trust in digital infrastructure paramount. Corporate campuses are self-contained cities, their glass towers piercing the smoggy sky, while the "wilderness" consists of vast server farms, forgotten data centers, and the "garage economy" of independent developers.

This era is characterized by an intense ideological conflict: the "Open Source Path" champions transparency, data privacy, and ethical AI development, contrasting sharply with the "Black Box Empire" which thrives on proprietary data exploitation, predatory algorithms, and manipulative user engagement. The established order, represented by old-guard giants like "Kosala Corp," grapples with maintaining its ethical foundations while fending off disruptive, often morally ambiguous, challengers. Power is wielded through control over network protocols, digital infrastructure, and the ability to shape public perception through sophisticated AI-driven narrative engines.

The overarching atmosphere is one of relentless innovation mixed with underlying anxiety about data integrity and digital sovereignty. "Dharma" in this world translates to adhering to the principles of ethical computing, ensuring data privacy, and fostering open collaboration for the greater digital good. Those who stray from this path risk "digital exile," being de-platformed, or having their projects "forked" and repurposed by rivals. The very fabric of society is woven from code, and a single line of malicious script can bring down an empire, making the pursuit of digital righteousness a constant, vigilant endeavor.

## Setting Details
Key locations include the gleaming, interconnected campuses of major tech conglomerates like "Kosala Corp," where innovation labs churn out world-changing algorithms and data centers hum with the heartbeat of global information. These campuses, such as the "Ayodhya Nexus," are luxurious, self-sustaining ecosystems with drone-delivery networks and AI-managed amenities, symbolizing ultimate power and influence. In stark contrast, the "Digital Wilderness" comprises remote, off-grid server farms and co-working spaces in repurposed industrial zones, serving as havens for independent developers and "garage startups" operating on limited resources, like the humble "Chitrakoot Co-op."

The technology level is hyper-advanced, featuring sentient AI, quantum computing infrastructure, bio-digital interfaces, and ubiquitous augmented reality overlays that seamlessly integrate with daily life. "Mana" or "magic" is replaced by mastery of complex code, advanced network protocols, and the ability to manipulate digital ecosystems. A master coder can "manifest" digital constructs, "hack" reality's overlays, or "summon" autonomous agents to do their bidding. Social hierarchies are based on one's "Influence Score," the success of their "IP portfolio," and their standing within powerful "Digital Houses" (families/firms).
