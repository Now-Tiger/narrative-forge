## World Overview
The year is 2077, and the world is governed not by nations, but by sprawling digital ecosystems, each controlled by a handful of mega-corporations and their associated venture capital syndicates. This is the "Data Age," where influence, wealth, and social standing are derived from one's "Digital Footprint Score" and contribution to the global network. Silicon Valley, now a sprawling megalopolis known as the "Nexus," remains the pulsating heart of innovation, a hyper-competitive arena where startups rise and fall in mere weeks, and legacy tech giants, like the venerable Kosala Technologies, strive to maintain their dominance through constant disruption and aggressive market acquisition. The general atmosphere is one of perpetual hustle, relentless optimization, and a pervasive belief that any problem can be solved with enough data and a brilliant algorithm, fostering a culture where code is law and reputation is currency.

Society is stratified by access to premium data streams, proprietary AI, and exclusive digital domains, creating a clear hierarchy where "Founders" and "Lead Architects" of successful ventures sit atop a pyramid of "Developers," "Users," and the digitally disenfranchised "Off-Gridders." The physical world is largely augmented by ubiquitous AR overlays, smart infrastructure, and drone-delivered services, blurring the lines between the tangible and the virtual. Every interaction, every transaction, every line of code is meticulously logged and analyzed, contributing to a complex social credit system that rewards innovation and conformity while penalizing "digital dissenters" or those who fail to contribute to the collective data pool.
