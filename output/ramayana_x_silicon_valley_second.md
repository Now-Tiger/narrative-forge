## World Overview
In a not-so-distant future, the world is woven into a sprawling, hyper-connected digital tapestry known as the "Global Network." This isn't just the internet; it's an immersive, neural-linked reality where physical space blends seamlessly with augmented layers of data, reputation scores, and algorithmic influence. Power isn't measured in land or gold, but in data streams, network bandwidth, and the sheer computational might of one's server farms, which have become the new corporate empires. These mega-corporations, often founded by visionary (or megalomaniacal) "Arch-Developers" generations ago, function as sovereign states, their sprawling campuses resembling self-contained cities, each governed by an intricate web of digital ethics and corporate protocols.

The atmosphere is one of relentless innovation and cutthroat competition, where "disruption" is the highest virtue and obsolescence is a constant threat. Individuals are valued by their "karma scores," a blockchain-verified reputation system that tracks everything from professional achievements and ethical conduct to social media engagement and open-source contributions. A high karma score grants access to privileged networks, coveted projects, and advanced bio-enhancements, while a low score can lead to digital exile, limiting one's access to vital services and even deplatforming them from the Global Network itself.

Beneath the glittering surface of ubiquitous AR displays and seamless neural interfaces, a subtle but constant battle wages for the soul of the network. Ideals of "Net-Dharma"—the ethical principles of data privacy, user autonomy, and benevolent AI—clash with the predatory algorithms of data harvesting, surveillance capitalism, and monopolistic practices. The foundational code of the Global Network is almost a sacred text, its integrity fiercely guarded by "Code Guardians" who believe in open-source collaboration and decentralized power, while rogue factions seek to exploit its vulnerabilities for personal gain or to establish authoritarian control over its vast resources. This digital landscape is a battleground for the future of humanity, where lines of code can shape destinies and a single hack can bring empires to their knees.

## Setting Details
The most significant locations in this world are the sprawling "Mega-Campus" headquarters of the major tech conglomerates, like the gleaming spires of "Ayodhya Systems" – a benevolent AI and ethical data processing giant, renowned for its open-source initiatives and commitment to user privacy. In stark contrast, the "Darknet Citadel" of "Lanka Corp" exists as a shadowy, heavily fortified data fortress, a rogue entity specializing in predatory algorithms, deepfake technology, and illicit data harvesting, operating just beyond the legal boundaries of the Global Network. Between these two poles lie the "Digital Wilds" – vast, less-governed regions of the network, often old, forgotten server farms, encrypted dark-web enclaves, or even physical areas with limited connectivity, where the "unplugged" or "exiled" can attempt to operate outside the omnipresent karma score system.

Technology has reached a level where neural implants provide direct brain-computer interfaces, allowing for instantaneous data recall, telepresence, and collaborative coding sessions within shared virtual workspaces. "Magical systems" are manifested through advanced quantum cryptography, the manipulation of complex AI constructs, and the ability to craft hyper-realistic simulations or "reality overlays" that can deceive even the most sophisticated network monitors. Social hierarchies are rigid yet fluid, dominated by "Arch-Developers" (founding CEOs) and their "VPs of Vision," followed by "Lead Algorists," "Data Sages," and finally the vast legions of remote "Code-Minions" and "Gig-Processors." Economic systems are almost entirely blockchain-based, with "cryptocurrency" and "data-credits" being the primary forms of exchange, while intellectual property, particularly groundbreaking algorithms and AI models, is the ultimate commodity. Daily life revolves around constant digital interaction, participation in global hackathons, virtual meetings in holographic environments, and the omnipresent pursuit of higher karma scores through ethical contributions and innovative solutions, all while navigating a complex web of corporate loyalties and digital etiquette.
